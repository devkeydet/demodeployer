# Introduction
This project will be a combination of a PowerApp and Azure Functions which will help the team find both GTM and team member built demos.  Once found, through the PowerApp, one will be able to provide environment information (Dynamics 365 instance, admin credentials, and Azure subscription (in cases where azure is part of the solution), etc.) in and deploy the demo to their target environment.
